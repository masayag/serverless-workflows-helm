# MTA Workflow

Migration Toolkit for Application Analysis (MTA) workflow performs an evaluation of applications to determine potential risks and the associated costs of containerizing the applications. It uses the [MTA Operator](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/6.2/html/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/index) to perform the analysis.
At the end of a successful assessment workflow, a link to the report will be available in Backstage, under the notifications plugin.
