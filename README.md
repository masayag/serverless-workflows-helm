## Orchestrator Workflows Helm Repository

This repository serves as a Helm chart repository for deploying serverless workflows with the Sonataflow Operator. It encompasses a collection of pre-defined workflows, each tailored to specific use cases. These workflows have undergone thorough testing and validation through Continuous Integration (CI) processes and are organized according to their chart versions.

The repository includes a variety of serverless workflows, such as:

* Greeting: A basic example workflow to demonstrate functionality.
* Migration Toolkit for Application Analysis (MTA): This workflow performs an evaluation of applications to determine potential risks and the associated costs of containerizing the applications.
* Move2Kube: Designed to facilitate the transition of an application to Kubernetes (K8s) environments.

## Usage
